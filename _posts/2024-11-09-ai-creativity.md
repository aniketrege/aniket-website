## What Does Creativity Mean to You?
My goal designing these posters was to *compare and contrast* my understanding of the ```human and AI creation process``` with simple analogies of where humans enjoy expressing their creativity. I chose art and music because I find myself observing a huge range of emotions when consuming art and music (though I personally struggle to be creative in these areas). I also chose cooking, as I feel able to express myself creatively through playing around with recipes (the gratification being instantly consumable is also quite satisfying). 

Through the visualizations below, I hope to encourage readers to consider and contemplate my position in the AI creativity debate<d-cite key="roose2022ai, cain2022capitol"></d-cite>: similar to philosopher Sean Dorrance Kelly<d-cite key="kelly2019philosopher"></d-cite>, I believe that ```while AI can create and be a tool for creation, it cannot be truly creative``` and evoke a sense of true wonder and emotion.

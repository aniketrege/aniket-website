I'm currently an MS EE student at the University of Washington, Seattle. I primarily spend my time as a graduate researcher in the RAIVN Lab mentored by [Aditya Kusupati](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~kusupati/) and supervised by Prof. [Ali Farhadi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ali/).

I will be joining the University of Wisconsin-Madison for a Ph.D in Computer Sciences this Fall!

In Summer '22 I interned in the deep learning for autonomous vehicles team at NVIDIA Redmond on Multiview LidarNet, supervised by Dr. [Nikolai Smolyanskiy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KxfefwgAAAAJ&hl=en). Previously, I worked for several years as a research engineer at Samsung Research India, working on perception problems for the AI Camera, including as a founding member of the [Single Take Camera](https://www.techradar.com/how-to/how-to-use-single-take-mode-on-samsung-phones) project, the USP of the Galaxy S20 flagship smartphone.

My master's research has focused on large-scale efficient and deployable machine learning, visual representation learning, and web-scale search. I am also interested in [contrastive learning](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/html/Cole_When_Does_Contrastive_Visual_Representation_Learning_Work_CVPR_2022_paper.html), learning from minimal supervison, and model robustness to real-world distribution shifts.
